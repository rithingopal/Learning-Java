hello,
project:blackjack 

Project Description: This project took me a while to understand the possible ways to create and the basic game rules which we need to implement
and make the cases run according to the game play . I have takes some references from the internet and tried to accomplish this far.
The basic structure of this project I have created 
1.classes for Cards, Deck, Suit,Players and main-method GameRunner.

2.Card Class:an implementation of card type.i have given mySuit and myNumber which represents my card numbers and suit.
created methods and used switch statement to create numbers of card that we give from 1-10 & jack,queen,king,ace.

3.Suit Class: this class describes the type of symbols  used on cards.I used emum command to represent a fixed set of constants.
clubs,Diamonds,spades,Hearts.

4.Deck class:An implementation of Deck of cards,I used "import java.util.Random" because we use Deck shuffling .I gave number of cards by using 
numCards to specify number of cards which i use.I created a constructor that defines the number of decks(i.e how many sets of 52 cards are
in the deck) whether is should be shuffled.

5.Player class.Implements of a blackjack players.describes player name ,cards in player current hand. method to see sum of cards in player's hand
to caliculate each card's contribution to hand sum.

6.GameRunner : implements the main method and uses commands like scanner.initiate the player objects,print intial hands.used boolean method to flags for when each player is finished hitting
players turn and dealer turn and print final hands who ever sum is greater that21 is the winner.

Problems Faced:
in main method how to add the players hits and initiating player objects i have taken the reference and 
i had accomplished with the technque with basic algorithm used in the main method and set handSum with cardNum.
even in the deck class i have learned how to implement the numToCards to the deck how to printdeck .
